You know, I was God once. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go&hellip; look for more stuff to steal! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.</p>
                        <p>Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Also Zoidberg. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Bender?! You stole the atom. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. How much did you make me?</p>
                        <p>I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Daddy Bender, we're hungry. It must be wonderful.</p>
                        <p>Do a flip! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Can I use the gun? You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!</p>
                        <p>Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine.  He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!</p>
                        <p>Leela's gonna kill me. Say what? Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. Is that a cooking show?</p>
                        <p>There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Oh, I don't have time for this.  I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.</p>
                        <p>Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. You can see how I lived before I met you.</p>
                        <p>It doesn't look so shiny to me. No! Don't jump! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.</p>
                        <p>Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</p>
                        <p>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. No, of course not. It was&hellip; uh&hellip; porno. Yeah, that's it. Bite my shiny metal ass. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be&hellip; Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.</p>
